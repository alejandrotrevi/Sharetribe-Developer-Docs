# Managing Listing Availability
Learn about timezones and availability management in the Template.

## Availability Plan Types and Timezone Support
The Sharetribe APIs support creating availability plans with either type `availabilityPlan/day` with day-level availability or type `availabilityPlan/time` with time range level availability. When a user creates a listing with the Sharetribe Web Template, the listing is always created with type `availabilityPlan/time`, whether the calendar booking type is daily, nightly, hourly or fixed.

Using the `availabilityPlan/time` type means that the template can specify a certain time zone for the listing's availability plan, which is asked when creating a bookable listing. The timezone is associated with the availability plan and ensures that all booking times are interpreted according to the local time of the listing, rather than the time zone of the customer making the booking. The `availabilityPlan/day` type always assumes UTC as the timezone.

However, there is a tradeoff. In order to [query listings](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/marketplace.html#query-listings) that use `availabilityPlan/time`, the `availability` parameter needs to be set to `time-full` or `time-partial`. Queries using this `availability` parameter do not support pagination.

By default, the template will display the first 24 results when using the date filter (and as pagination is not supported, the results will be limited to 24). This value can be modified in [SearchPage.duck.js file](https://github.com/sharetribe/web-template/blob/main/src/containers/SearchPage/SearchPage.duck.js#L21), so you can allow displaying up to a 100 results.

## Availability Management
For daily and nightly listings, the template simplifies availability management by allowing the provider to select their daily availability. Under the hood, availability is automatically set from `00:00` to `00:00` (i.e., midnight to midnight), enabling bookings to span for consecutive days.

For hourly and fixed booking length listings, the template exposes full control over start and end times when adjusting availability entries. These entries can be consecutive or non-consecutive and may have varying seat counts. While it is technically possible to create a continuous availability window from `00:00` to `00:00`, enabling bookings that span entire days or overnight, the template does not have built-in support for creating hourly bookings that span multiple calendar days.

### Availability Plan
For daily and nightly bookings, exceptions are created per day, and the start and end dates can be the same date. For nightly bookings, exceptions are created per night, and the end date needs to be at least one day later than the start date. For hourly bookings and fixed-length bookings, exceptions are created with a start time and an end time, and the end time needs to be at least an hour later, and on the hour, e.g., 13:00 or 14:00.

Regardless of the unit type, all exceptions are made using the same [endpoint](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/marketplace.html#create-availability-exceptions).

Providers can also block availability by using seats. Setting 0 seats for the duration of the availability exception sets the listing as unavailable for that period. If the period has existing bookings, the availability exception will not affect them, so it only blocks future bookings.

The availability plan, availability exceptions, and bookings are only visible to the provider of the listing. When other users view the listingâ€™s availability on the listing page, they only see whether the listing is available, but they cannot see whether the availability results from the availability plan, exceptions, or existing bookings.

### Listing Search and Timezone Coverage
The operator can allow users to search for listings based on their availability on certain dates. The date search cannot be restricted to specific time zones. This means that to cover listings from all possible time zones, the template prolongs the start and end times before sending them to the Sharetribe API. See the relevant code [in SearchPage.duck.js](https://github.com/sharetribe/web-template/blob/main/src/containers/SearchPage/SearchPage.duck.js#L185-L186).

To be exact, the start time is moved 14 hours earlier, and the end time is moved 12 hours later. This means that the availability search results may include listings that are available before or after the time frame that the user enters.

### Filtering Timeslot with Intervals
When querying timeslots for a listing using the booking unit "fixed" or "hourly", the template uses [interval-based filtering](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/references/availability/#interval-based-filtering). This approach allows retrieving significantly less data from the API than using regular timeslot queries (the API is restricted to 500 timeslots per page). A regular timeslot query can only fetch up to 500 time slots at once, and to fetch more than that you need to make multiple queries. When using short fixed time slots, e.g. 15 minutes, one day might have dozens of available time slots, so the first 500 time slots of a month might only cover a few weeks worth of availability. The date picker component needs to know whether there is availability on a certain day, so the template makes a query that matches the first available timeslot within the defined interval. See the full query in [ListingPage.duck.js](https://github.com/sharetribe/web-template/blob/main/src/containers/ListingPage/ListingPage.duck.js#L495).

This information is used to display the availability of a listing in the monthly calendar view when booking.
