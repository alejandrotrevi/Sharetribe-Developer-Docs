# Create a staging environment

Deploy your marketplace to a cloud hosting platform to share it with other people.

## What is a staging environment?

So far, you have been developing your marketplace in a development environment on your local machine. At some point during the development process, you will want to start testing features in an environment where a server exposes your website to the public Internet. Using a cloud hosting service like [Render](https://www.render.com) or [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/), you can deploy your application to a server, after which your marketplace will be accessible through a public URL.

## Prepare to publish your marketplace

Before deploying your staging environment, you want to make sure Server-Side Rendering (SSR) works. In addition, password-protecting your staging environment is a good idea to prevent it from being accessed by unauthorized users.

### Test server-side rendering locally

Before you deploy your marketplace to Render or another hosting service, you should first ensure that your client application runs without error when using SSR.

The Sharetribe Web Template has a small [Node/Express](https://expressjs.com/) server that enables SSR. It allows pages to be rendered faster than on the client, making it easier for search engines to index your website (in case they don't execute JavaScript).

To start up the server locally, you will need to run the command:

```shell
yarn run dev-server
```

This command will run the actual Node/Express server in `server/index.js` so you can test server-side rendering, simulating how the client application would run in a production environment.

### Enable HTTP basic access authentication

You can enforce access control in your web application by enabling HTTP basic access authentication. Itâ€™s a good idea to restrict access to your web application while still testing your marketplace: it prevents your site from being indexed in search engines and users from accidentally signing up in a marketplace still under development.

Sharetribe Web Template exposes two environment variables with which you can set a username and password to limit access to your web application. When you deploy your application to Render, remember to define the following environment variables:

- `BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME`
- `BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD`

This will prevent anybody without the correct password and username from accessing your staging marketplace.

## Deploy to Render

This section provides a step-by-step guide on how to deploy your marketplace to Render. You can also deploy your marketplace on another cloud hosting platform, but we suggest using Render as it provides a [free tier](https://render.com/pricing) and is quick and easy to set up.

### Create an account on Render

Go to Render and [create a new account](https://dashboard.render.com/register) if you do not have one already.

### Create a new app

Go to the [Render dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com) and create a new application. Select "web service":

![Create new app in Render](https://docs.static/47eb53ce7a8032570205e2b908644507/53fb6/render-create-new-app.png)

### Connect Render with a GitHub repository

Log in using your GitHub account and give Render permission to access the repository you want to deploy.

### Configure settings and environment variables

Give your web service a name. You do not need to touch any other settings (such as environment, branch, build command and start command), and select the free plan. Before clicking on "create web service", click on "Advanced" to enter the required environment variables.

You can choose to enter the environment variables one-by-one through the browser interface or by creating a secret file that contains all environment variables.

#### Required Environment Variables

1. **`REACT_APP_SHARETRIBE_SDK_CLIENT_ID`**
   - Sharetribe client ID. Check this from [Console](https://console.sharetribe.com/advanced/applications).

2. **`SHARETRIBE_SDK_CLIENT_SECRET`**
   - Sharetribe client secret. Check this from [Console](https://console.sharetribe.com/advanced/applications).

3. **`REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`**
   - Stripe publishable API key for generating tokens with Stripe API. Use the test key (prefix `pk_test`) for development.

4. **`REACT_APP_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`**
   - If you are using Mapbox instead of Google Maps.

5. **`REACT_APP_SHARETRIBE_MARKETPLACE_CURRENCY`**
   - The currency used in the Marketplace is formatted in the ISO 4217 currency code. For example, USD, EUR, CAD, AUD, etc.

6. **`REACT_APP_MARKETPLACE_ROOT_URL`**
   - This is the root URL of the marketplace. Remove trailing slash from the domain (e.g. `https://<the-name-of-your-app>.onrender.com`).

7. **`REACT_APP_MARKETPLACE_NAME`**
   - Marketplace name in self-hosted marketplaces is set through environment variables. If not set, this defaults to 'Biketribe' in `src/config/configDefault.js`.

8. **`NODE_ENV`**
   - Defines whether the application is run in production or development mode. Use 'development' for development and 'production' for production.

9. **`REACT_APP_ENV`**
   - A more fine-grained env definition than `NODE_ENV`. Use value: 'production' if you are using HTTP basic access authentication, and value 'development' otherwise.

10. **`REACT_APP_SHARETRIBE_USING_SSL`**
    - When using Render, this value should be set to false. Redirect HTTP to HTTPS? Use value: false.

11. **`SERVER_SHARETRIBE_TRUST_PROXY`**
    - Set this when running the app behind a reverse proxy, e.g. in Heroku.

12. **`REACT_APP_CSP`**
    - Content Security Policy (CSP). Accepts values: *block* and *report*. The recommended value is *block*.

13. **`REACT_APP_AVAILABILITY_ENABLED`**
    - Possible values: true/false. Use value: true.

14. **`REACT_APP_DEFAULT_SEARCHES_ENABLED`**
    - Possible values: true/false. Use value: true.

If you change these values later on, *you need to redeploy the app*. Environment variables are baked into the static build files of the web app, so a new build is required.

### Create web service

Once you are ready, click on the "create web service" button and wait for your build to be deployed. Once the build is complete, you will be able to access your marketplace through the URL displayed in the Render dashboard.

### Domains and certificates

Render manages TLS certificates [automatically](https://render.com/docs/tls) for new applications. You can enable a custom domain through the *Settings tab*. Read more through [Render's documentation](https://render.com/docs/custom-domains).

## What next?

Now that your marketplace is running in a staging environment, you should test the app thoroughly using both desktop and mobile layouts. In addition, you should try to:

- Create new users
- Create new listings
- Book listings
- Test social sharing
  - [Facebook sharing debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/)
  - [Twitter card validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)
- Save payment card
  - Use [test card numbers](https://stripe.com/docs/testing).

In [the next part of this tutorial](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/tutorial/add-new-wizard-tab/), we'll go through how to add new tabs to the listing wizard.
