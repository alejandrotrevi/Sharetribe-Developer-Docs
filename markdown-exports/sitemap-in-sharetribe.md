# Introduction
This guide describes how the Sharetribe tooling supports creating a sitemap for your marketplace.

Having a sitemap on your marketplace helps search engines to crawl and index your website correctly. For a traditional website, sitemaps are relatively easy to make, because all of your routes are built in to the application.

However, on a marketplace, it is likely that you will have listing URLs that include dynamic data from each listing â€“ and you still want search engines to index those pages. Sharetribe offers API endpoints for fetching sitemap data for [listings](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/marketplace.html#query-list-of-listings) and [CMS pages](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/marketplace.html#query-list-of-assets).

### Information
The Sharetribe Web Template has tooling to create a dynamic sitemap by default. Read more about the template sitemap structure and logic: **[Sitemap in Sharetribe Web Template](https://www.sharetribe.com/docs/template/sitemap-in-template/)**.

If you are creating your own custom application, you can consider whether you want to use the same practices that the web template uses to craft the sitemap.

## Separate sitemaps for static and dynamic content
Static content sitemaps help search engines quickly index unchanging pages like your "About" page, while dynamic content sitemaps focus on frequently updated or user-generated content, such as listings in your marketplace.

For example, the Sharetribe Web Template generates three different sub-sitemaps linked from *sitemap-index.xml*, all with slightly different data:

- *sitemap-default.xml* exposes public built-in pages in the template. Non-public routes that require authentication are disallowed in the *robots.txt* file.
- *sitemap-recent-listings.xml* exposes routes to the most recently created listings. The listing data is fetched from a specific [sitemapData endpoint](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/marketplace.html#query-list-of-listings). The endpoint returns the 10,000 most recent listings.
- *sitemap-recent-pages.xml* exposes routes to the CMS pages created in Console that do not have built-in paths in the client application. The page data is fetched from a specific [sitemapData endpoint](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/marketplace.html#query-list-of-assets).

It is good to note that the sitemap API endpoints cache results for one day, so sitemaps generated using the sitemap API endpoints do not update in real time.

If your marketplace has more than 10,000 listings, you will need to fetch the information for older listings through Integration API. Since the Integration API [listing query endpoint](https://www.sharetribe.com/api-reference/integration.html#query-listings) is paginated, you will need to filter the results by e.g. the *createdAt* attribute to retrieve all listings.

## Caching
In addition to the API endpoint caching, the template has its own cache for one day, so the combined cache effect can be up to two days. You can consider what kind of caching approach would work in your client application.

Especially on bigger sites with multiple listings, listing sitemap data can take up to a few seconds to fetch from the SDK. Caching the results improves the sitemap performance.
